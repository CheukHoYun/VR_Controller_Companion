# VR_Controller_Companion

Works just like [Controller Companion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367670/Controller_Companion/), but for VR controllers.

### TODO:
- Change the input system from legacy to [new](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/wiki/SteamVR-Input).
- Allow key-bindings to be read from / write to a JSON file. 
- Make an UI.
